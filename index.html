            <p>
              <br>
                HARRISON & JUSTICE CHILDREN'S HOME (HJCH) is a non-governmental organization
working as a child refuge and adoption center founded in 2004 in Kitale, Kenya. HJCH is
mandated by the local social services and children's department supported by an existing
court order to provide shelter, care and rehabilitation programs to destitute, homeless
children in Kitale.<br> HJCH is periodically vetted by the social services and children's
department to ensure adherence to safety standards for orphanages.<br><br>
As part of its rehabilitation program, the home provides food, shelter, clothing, medical
support, guiding and counseling services, and educational support up to high school level
for all children.<br> While the home depends on donors and well-wishers to support its
orphanage programs, it is looking to grow sustainably by undertaking farming and
business activities to generate income.

            <h3><b>OUR HISTORY</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p>HARRISON & JUSTICE CHILDREN'S HOME started as a simple idea to provide foster care to
                three teenage boys who had lost their parents in 2000 in Kital town. In 2001, Laban
                Wayoga, the founder of HJCH, took up the three boys aged 8 to 12, and though single and
                unemployed at the time, made every effort to provide food and shelter to them.<br> He found
                some support from a missionary couple from Texas, USA, who were then running Calvary
                Baptist Church, and they partnered to educate the boys. HJCH was officially set up as an
                orphanage in 2004 after seeing a successful outcome with the three boys, who have gone
                to become successful at their young careers, with one of the boys having been privileged
                to attend and graduate from Duke University in the USA owing to his excellent academic
                performance. <br>He is currently giving back to the home in many ways.<br>
                Laban set up HJCH as a dedication to his two late brothers (Harrison a former US resident
                in Atlanta and Justice a former legal advocate in Kitale) who had dedicated themselves to
                social and charity work in their communities. <br>Laban saw an opportunity to continue their
                legacy by providing a center for hope and inspiration for orphaned kids, many who had
                lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, poverty and domestic violence. Laban, currently a certified
                theologian, and his wife Norah have dedicated the rest of their lives to supporting
                destitute children realize their potential and future.</p>
